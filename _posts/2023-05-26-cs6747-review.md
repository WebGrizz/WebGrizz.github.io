## Introduction

1. *Introduction*
- *Provide an overview of the module you are reviewing, including its title, the level of the course it belongs to, and the objectives of the module.*

To calibrate expectations, [CS6747 Advanced Malware Analysis](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-6747-advanced-malware-analysis) is a class that teaches less about analyzing malicious software behavior and more about black-box software analysis. In other words, techniques like unpacking or spotting anti-VM are only mentioned lightly, and the bulk of the course and labs focus on getting familiar with Ghidra and Intel Pin tools and techniques to analyze a software's behavior without any source code.

With that out of the way, this course is one of the best courses I've taken. I took this course in Fall 2022 (before ChatGPT was released). It has a graduate-level course rigor, yet it provides a gentle start for those who have not touched assembly language since their undergraduate Operating Systems class.

~~A little about my background, this is my concurrent 4th/5th OMSCS course and I’ve previously taken Network Security. I graduated with a bachelor’s in CS and was a software engineer but have never coded significant assembly code.~~

## Teaching methods

- *Evaluate the teaching methods used in the module, such as lectures, practical sessions, tutorials, or online resources.*
- *Assess how effective the teaching methods were in helping you understand the course content and in achieving the module's learning outcomes.*

There are weekly lectures, and the quality of the videos is good. There are a couple of short office hours with the professor. One week of slides gives an overview of packers and executable formats in malware. The rest of the weeks focus on tools, techniques, and algorithms on how to convert raw instructions into various graphs that are directly useful in the projects.

There are no exams. 

There are some recommended textbooks but I didn’t read them (33 papers are enough). I did use 

The forums are where the real learning happens. The TAs are active and besides one occasion where they left out critical information, they are indispensable for lab exercises.

I’ve attended the professor’s office hours but usually they are empty (unlike in the forums). The professor is patient and (in my limited interaction) quite cool with dumb questions.

## Grading and Assessment methods
5/5

- *Evaluate the fairness and validity of the assessment methods in assessing your understanding of the course content and in measuring the module's learning outcomes.*

The labs use the same sample malware, and we are allowed to do the labs in pairs. Although I did not pair up, I highly recommend doing so.

- Lab #1: Intro to Ghidra (15%) — Compile a very simple C code, decompile it in Ghidra, and comment on it. It's a gentle introduction to opening Ghidra and understanding assembly code.
- Lab #2: Static Malware Reverse Engineering (15%) — Similar to Lab #1, but this time, decompile an actual malware and comment on about 6000 lines of instructions. (I did this course pre-ChatGPT, so I will not be surprised if this changes)
- Lab #3: Basic Def Use GHIDRA Plugin (15%) — Generate a Def/Use DOT graph using the Ghidra API. Scripting in Python or Java is required, but there is a lot of support for the setup.
- Lab #4: Data Dependence GHIDRA Plugin (15%) — Use your def/use DOT graph from Lab #3 and generate a DDG. The graph is used to observe how the malware handles data.
- Lab #5: Dynamic Control Flow Tracing (15%) — Generate a dynamic Control Flow Graph (CFG) using the PinTool API. There are sample C++ codes in the official Intel PinTool documentation to get started. In my class, there was massive confusion about the setup and how to kill the malware with the provided kill script, but a classmate (not TA) figured it out.
- Lab #6: Dynamic Control Dependence (15%) — Use the results from Lab #5 and generate a Control Dependence Graph (CDG). The recommended algorithm is from the paper "Efficient Online Detection of Dynamic Control Dependence" (Xin, B., 2007), so I had to implement it in Python. Out of the other labs, this required the most reading up on papers and websites outside of the slides.
- PowerPoint slides summary of 33 papers (10%) — Each paper just requires 1 ppt slide, so it’s 33 slides in total. I did this course pre-ChatGPT but I can vouch the papers (or at least their introductions) are interesting to read!

Grading is more lenient than expected but the challenge is getting a basic 

Assessment methods with labs are fair and I thoroughly understood all the slides content even though there aren’t exams. While there are plenty of ways to get extra credits, they are not significant enough to replace any lab.

## Content

<!---
- *Outline the topics covered in the module and provide a brief summary of each.*
- *Discuss the relevance of the content to the overall course and the relevance of the topics to the field of computer science.*
-->

The topics covered in the course includes:

1. High level language constructs in assembly
2. Static malware analysis tools using Ghidra API
3. Static analysis techniques like tracking stack pointers and register dependencies
4. Dynamic malware analysis tools using Intel PinTool API
5. Dynamic analysis techniques like program slicing

Personally, I am slightly disappointed the coding projects emphasise a lot on instruction-to-graph conversion and very little on malicious actor techniques like packing or anti-reverse engineering. This may give the impression that it is less of a malware analysis class and more of a black box software analysis class. It’s not a deal-breaker because as far as I know, it is relevant to an advanced malware courses in sans (https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-advanced-code-analysis/). 

Some reviewers have recommended to take this course before CS6265 Binary Exploitation. I’ve taken both courses concurrently and I agree with them. For those unfamilar with the differences between these 2 modules, here’s my analogy... The whole field of cybersecurity is like protecting a house: 

1) A penetration tester is like a thief that use various tools to overcome various defences (e.g. a paper clip crafted for a lock to break into the house) — they usually only have a basic idea of how these tools work. 

2) An binary exploit developer (sometimes called vulnerability researcher) is an expert in developing the thief’s tools. A big part of making these tools is understanding and reversing these entry point locks.

3) A malware analyst usually don’t reverse “locks” or any entry points but they reverse larger tools (i.e. a payload) like a suspicious “clock in the house” that is actually a hidden camera that collects information and send it to a C&C server. 

The 2 modules have many similarities such as the heavy use of Ghidra and reading assembly code. By the end of the 2 modules, one should be an expert at using Ghidra!

## Resources

<!---
- Evaluate the resources provided to support your learning, such as textbooks, online resources, or software tools.
- Discuss the accessibility and quality of the resources provided, and suggest any improvements that could be made.

The course is mostly self-contained but may occasionally require googling for Ghidra API help. However, most students did a deeper googling for Lab #2 to get a basic idea of the malware's basic functionality.

Addtional resources:

1) SANS courses (paid but well known in my country): [FOR610: Reverse-Engineering Malware: Malware Analysis Tools and Techniques](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/) and [FOR710: Reverse-Engineering Malware: Advanced Code Analysis](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-advanced-code-analysis/)

2) Textbook: [Practical Binary Analysis](https://practicalbinaryanalysis.com/) by Dennis Andriesse. Chapter 9.3-9.5 was helpful for Lab #5

3) Other academic courses: [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute - Malware Analysis](https://github.com/RPISEC/Malware) and [CNIT 126: Practical Malware Analysis](https://samsclass.info/126/126_S16.shtml)

## Conclusion

<!---
- Summarize your overall experience of the module, including its strengths and weaknesses.
- Offer any suggestions for how the module could be improved, and make recommendations for students considering taking the module in the future.

Overall, CS6747 is a great module that teaches practical malware analysis skills. It is not a dealbreaker that the module doesn't teach anti-reverse engineering topics but I felt it motivated me to read up and learn more about reverse engineering.
